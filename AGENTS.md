# KubeLens Agent Instructions

## Documentation hygiene
- For any major feature, infrastructure, or workflow change, update `docs/changelogs.md` under the current release heading.
- Update the most relevant page(s) under `docs/` (e.g. `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/deploy.md`).
- If a new doc is added, link it in `docs/index.md`.

## Release notes
- Keep release notes concise and user-facing.
- Group changes by functional area (streaming, auth, storage, deployment, UI).
